World of Warcraft 2.4.3 Hunter Auto Shot tracking AddOn

Description copied from my original forum post:

Update 1: I fixed an issue, where the AddOn would think that you were constantly moving, if you pressed the jump button again in air. Also something I remembered: the AddOn doesn't recognize that you're moving, if you're strafing by holding down RMB and using the keybinds to turn (for example "Turn Right" instead of "Strafe Right"). If that's an issue to you, just bind strafe right and strafe left like any sane person should.

I just started working on an Auto Shot timer. I'm still not sure about the look and feel, and it hasn't been thoroughly tested, but it does display CD and cast time. It also recognizes when you move, and it has a timer that shows how much before or after the 0.5 second cast time you stopped.

The cast time is displayed as the red bar at the bottom, so it's safe to move when the main bar isn't over it.

I want it to eventually display Steady Shot clipping as well, but I'm not sure if I'll get that ready before the launch. I'm kinda busy with some other things.

There's no in-game config. You can change width, height and position at the top of the .lua file.
